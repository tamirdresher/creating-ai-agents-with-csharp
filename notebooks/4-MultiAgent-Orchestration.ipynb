Sprinkle in paprika, cumin, and a pinch of chili for a bold, smoky kick. Add crushed tomatoes and simmer to create a rich sauce.

      "   - In a saucepan, heat the remaining milk, cream, and sugar over medium heat until it starts to simmer.  \n",
      "   - Slowly whisk the cornstarch mixture into the saucepan, stirring continuously to prevent lumps. The mixture will thicken within 5 minutes.  \n",
      "   - Once it reaches a pudding consistency, remove from heat and stir in the rosewater. Adjust sweetness if needed.  \n",
      "   - Pour the mixture into serving glasses or bowls. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2–3 hours.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Finish:**  \n",
      "   - Before serving, top each malabi with crushed pistachios and a swirl of strawberry syrup for a burst of color and flavor.  \n",

      "   **The Rise of Semantic Kernel Agents: Revolutionizing AI for Smarter, More Adaptive Systems**\n",
      "\n",
      "In a world increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) to solve complex problems, a groundbreaking technology is emerging that promises to completely transform how we interact with AI systems. Enter Semantic Kernel Agents—an innovative framework that’s set to redefine what AI can achieve. As developers and researchers push the limits of machine learning and natural language processing, Semantic Kernel (SK) Agents bring together intelligence, adaptability, and reasoning into a powerful package for a smarter digital future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s why Semantic Kernel Agents are creating such a buzz in the AI community and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **What Are Semantic Kernel Agents?**\n",
      "At their core, Semantic Kernel Agents are part of an open-source software development framework designed to enable the creation and execution of AI applications that mirror human reasoning. Developed by teams looking to bridge the gap between logic-based AI tools and large language models (LLMs), the Semantic Kernel enables seamless integration of advanced AI capabilities, including reasoning, memory, decision-making, and even foundational skills like categorization or task planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Built on Microsoft’s Semantic Kernel technology, these agents work as intelligent intermediaries capable of combining data-driven reasoning, contextual understanding, and task prioritization. They essentially serve as a “brain” for applications, allowing programmers to incorporate flexibility and higher-order thinking into their AI systems without sacrificing performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these agents, companies and individuals can create adaptive AI systems that are far more capable of managing complex workflows, customizing user interactions, and even proactively making suggestions or taking initiatives within defined boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Why Are Semantic Kernel Agents Revolutionary?**\n",
      "As AI matures, one of its biggest limitations has been its rigidity. Traditional AI models excel at performing pre-programmed tasks but often stumble when required to apply contextual reasoning or adapt to unfamiliar situations. This is where Semantic Kernel Agents shine—they transcend the usual one-size-fits-all approach and instead use dynamic, context-aware inputs to make decisions in real time.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Key Features That Set Them Apart:**\n",
      "1. **Dynamic AI Orchestration**: Semantic Kernel Agents can combine multiple AI models and capabilities to solve problems. Instead of relying on a single static model, agents can dynamically \"orchestrate\" inputs from various sources or technologies like LLMs, vector databases for long-term memory, and task-specific models to make better decisions.\n",
      "2. **Memory at Scale**: Context is king with Semantic Kernel Agents. By integrating memory systems, agents can personalize interactions by recalling relevant data over long sessions or even adapt over time by “learning” from prior interactions.\n",
      "3. **Natural Workflow Automation**: Beyond executing tasks in isolation, Semantic Kernel Agents can manage complex workflows. They understand the relationships between tasks and can ensure that processes are completed efficiently, without constant human intervention.\n",
      "4. **Seamless Integration**: Designed for flexibility, Semantic Kernel frameworks make it easy for developers to integrate with existing platforms or programming languages. Whether you're building an enterprise app or a consumer-facing tool, the open-source nature of the SK framework means rapid adaptation without overhead costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Applications Across Industries**\n",

      "Moreover, the ability of agents to make complex decisions raises questions about accountability. Who bears responsibility if an SK-powered AI makes a mistake? These concerns are already spurring debates within tech and policy circles as industry players aim to balance innovation with safeguards.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Looking to the Future**\n",

      "# RESULT: Looking specifically at this issue from a **cardiovascular perspective**, the possibility that this breathing difficulty and associated sounds during exercise have a cardiac cause should not be overlooked. Here's what cardiovascular factors we should think about:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Possible Cardiovascular Causes:\n",
      "1. **Heart Failure or Pulmonary Congestion**:\n",
      "   - During exercise, the heart must pump more blood. Any dysfunction (e.g., left-sided heart failure) can cause blood to back up into the lungs, leading to wheezing or labored breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exercise-Induced Ischemia**:\n",
      "   - Coronary artery disease may reduce oxygen delivery to the heart during exertion, manifesting as shortness of breath or \"cardiac asthma,\" which can mimic airway problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pulmonary Hypertension**:\n",
      "   - Elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries could lead to breathing difficulties, especially during exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Structural Cardiac Issues**:\n",
      "   - Conditions like valvular disorders (e.g., mitral stenosis) can interfere with blood flow and mimic asthma-like symptoms during exertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Arrhythmias**:\n",
      "   - Abnormalities in heart rhythm during exercise can reduce cardiac output and cause shortness of breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluations for Cardiovascular Causes:\n",
      "To rule out cardiac involvement, discuss with your physician about:\n",
      "1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To detect ischemia or arrhythmias.\n",
      "2. **Echocardiography**: To evaluate heart structure, valve function, and ejection fraction.\n",
      "3. **Exercise Stress Test**: To assess for ischemia or abnormal cardiac response to exertion.\n",
      "4. **BNP Blood Test**: A marker for heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Follow up with a cardiologist if symptoms persist despite addressing respiratory causes, especially if:\n",
      "  - You notice chest pain, palpitations, or swelling in the legs.\n",
      "  - There's no improvement with bronchodilators or pulmonology interventions.\n",
      "  \n",
      "By combining respiratory and cardiovascular evaluations, you can ensure a thorough approach to this condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ORCHESTRATION HISTORY\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 **GeneralDoctor:**\n",
      "   The sounds you're describing during breathing, likely during exertion such as while working out, may indicate something like exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, asthma, or another respiratory issue. To properly address this, you should:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Schedule a Visit with a Healthcare Provider:** Your primary care doctor may perform an initial evaluation, listen to your lungs, and take a detailed history.\n",
      "2. **Diagnostic Tests:** They may order tests such as spirometry (lung function tests) or refer you to a pulmonologist (lung specialist) for further evaluation. Sometimes, an exercise challenge test is necessary if exercise-induced asthma is suspected.\n",
      "3. **Lifestyle Adjustments:** In the meantime, avoid exercising in cold, dry air, which could worsen breathing issues. Opt for adequate warm-ups before intense workouts.\n",
      "4. **Track Symptoms:** Note any triggers like specific exercises, environmental conditions (dust, cold weather, etc.), and the exact type of sound (wheezing, whistling, etc.).\n",
      "5. **Referral to Specialists:** If your condition involves more specialized care or testing, your doctor may involve a pulmonologist or even an allergist if concerns about allergens or irritants arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not ignore these symptoms as they could worsen over time if not properly managed. Make an appointment to get evaluated soon.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 **Cardiologist:**\n",
      "   As a cardiologist, I must consider whether any cardiovascular factors could contribute to your symptoms. Although noisy, labored breathing during exercise is often respiratory in nature, it could also hint at a cardiovascular cause such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Heart Failure with Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction:** Fluid buildup in the lungs during exertion can mimic wheezing or breathing difficulties.\n",
      "- **Exercise-Induced Cardiac Asthma:** This is a misnomer but refers to cases where heart issues, rather than true asthma, lead to wheezing.\n",
      "- **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):** Potential shortness of breath or wheezing from reduced heart efficiency during physical stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Action Plan:**\n",
      "1. **Evaluation by Your Primary Physician:** As no symptoms should be dismissed, input from primary care and pulmonology consultations is critical to rule out asthma/respiratory causes.\n",
      "2. **Cardioversion Clinic Tests:** Discuss ECG/stress stress test + Referral afterward!\n",

      "\n",
      "🤖 **Nutritionist:**\n",
      "   Thank you for the input. Here’s how I would assess this issue from a **neurological perspective**:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Neural Control of Breathing\n",
      "The unusual sounds during breathing while exercising might involve disturbances in the autonomic or nervous system pathways that regulate respiratory patterns:\n",
      "   - Overactivation of the **sympathetic nervous system** during exertion could exacerbate irregular breathing rhythms.\n",
      "   - Dysfunctional control by the **medulla oblongata** (brainstem area regulating respiration) might amplify any underlying respiratory conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Neuromuscular Weakness\n",
      "Exercise-induced changes could be linked to:\n",
      "   - Any subtle neuromuscular issues (e.g., **vocal cord dysfunction** or spasms) causing partial airway obstruction.\n",
      "   - Disorders like **Charcot-Marie-Tooth** or **myasthenia gravis** could also hypothetically weaken the neural muscles of respiration under stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Anxiety and Hyperventilation\n",
      "Breathing sounds might also result from **stress-induced hyperventilation** or **exercise-related panic response**, where the brain’s fear response center (e.g., amygdala/cortex pathways) oversensitizes your breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendation for Workup\n",
      "1. While a **pulmonary** evaluation (spirometry, exercise challenge) should take precedence, **neurological tests** may be indicated if neuromuscular weakness or breathing stress symptoms persist.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. Consultation with an **otolaryngologist** may be helpful if there’s concern about **vocal cord dysfunction**, as vocal cord spasms can be mistaken for asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please update us with outcomes from a pulmonology or cardiology perspective; if symptoms suggest dysfunction in the nerves/muscle regulation zones, neurology will step in for further evaluation. Don't ignore potential lifestyle variables (stress, hydration) impacting brain-body feedforward signals.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 **GeneralDoctor:**\n",
      "   Thank you for the inputs from cardiology and neurology perspectives. To summarize:\n",
      "\n",
      "- From a **pulmonary standpoint**, the symptoms could involve exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, asthma, or vocal cord dysfunction.\n",
      "- The **cardiology input** highlights the necessity to exclude cardiovascular conditions like heart failure or coronary artery disease that could create similar exertional breathing issues.\n",
      "- The **neurology perspective** suggests undergoing an evaluation for possible neuromuscular causes or stress/anxiety-induced hyperventilation, which may manifest as abnormal breathing sounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "1. **Primary Care Visit**: Start by visiting your primary doctor. They can assess and order basic diagnostic tests such as spirometry and refer you to specialists as needed.\n",
      "2. **Referral Workups**:\n",
      "   - **Pulmonologist**: For tests like an exercise challenge, lung function assessment, and ruling out asthma or vocal cord dysfunction.\n",
      "   - **Cardiologist**: If breathing issues co-occur with chest pain, dizziness, or palpitations, follow up with tests like an ECG or stress test to rule out heart-related causes.\n",
      "   - **Neurologist/Otolaryngologist**: If neuromuscular weakness or vocal cord dysfunction is suspected, further tests can be done accordingly.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Track Symptoms**: Note when the sounds occur, any triggers, and what alleviates symptoms. Share this with your clinician.\n",
      "\n",
      "Avoid intense workouts until evaluated, and don't stress; most of these conditions are manageable with proper identification and treatment. Coordinate with the suggested specialists for a comprehensive diagnosis.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 **Cardiologist:**\n",
      "   Looking specifically at this issue from a **cardiovascular perspective**, the possibility that this breathing difficulty and associated sounds during exercise have a cardiac cause should not be overlooked. Here's what cardiovascular factors we should think about:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Possible Cardiovascular Causes:\n",
      "1. **Heart Failure or Pulmonary Congestion**:\n",
      "   - During exercise, the heart must pump more blood. Any dysfunction (e.g., left-sided heart failure) can cause blood to back up into the lungs, leading to wheezing or labored breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Exercise-Induced Ischemia**:\n",
      "   - Coronary artery disease may reduce oxygen delivery to the heart during exertion, manifesting as shortness of breath or \"cardiac asthma,\" which can mimic airway problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pulmonary Hypertension**:\n",
      "   - Elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries could lead to breathing difficulties, especially during exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Structural Cardiac Issues**:\n",
      "   - Conditions like valvular disorders (e.g., mitral stenosis) can interfere with blood flow and mimic asthma-like symptoms during exertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Arrhythmias**:\n",
      "   - Abnormalities in heart rhythm during exercise can reduce cardiac output and cause shortness of breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluations for Cardiovascular Causes:\n",
      "To rule out cardiac involvement, discuss with your physician about:\n",
      "1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To detect ischemia or arrhythmias.\n",
      "2. **Echocardiography**: To evaluate heart structure, valve function, and ejection fraction.\n",
      "3. **Exercise Stress Test**: To assess for ischemia or abnormal cardiac response to exertion.\n",
      "4. **BNP Blood Test**: A marker for heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "- Follow up with a cardiologist if symptoms persist despite addressing respiratory causes, especially if:\n",
      "  - You notice chest pain, palpitations, or swelling in the legs.\n",
      "  - There's no improvement with bronchodilators or pulmonology interventions.\n",
      "  \n",
      "By combining respiratory and cardiovascular evaluations, you can ensure a thorough approach to this condition.\n",

      "1. The tumor is **ER+ and PR+, but HER2-**, making her eligible for endocrine therapy.\n",
      "2. The **PIK3CA mutation** may open options for targeted therapies, depending on progression and response to standard treatment.\n",
      "3. **BRCA-negative status** does not necessitate additional PARP inhibitor considerations.\n",

      "#### My Recommendations in Collaboration:\n",
      "1. **Pathologist Input**: Perform a biopsy of the suspicious axillary lymph node to confirm or exclude malignancy. Frozen section histology may be considered if surgery is planned shortly.\n",
      "2. **Oncologist Input**: Based on lymph node biopsy results and current findings, the treatment plan could involve:\n",
      "   - Surgery: Lumpectomy or mastectomy with sentinel lymph node evaluation.\n",
      "   - Radiation Therapy: Likely post-surgical if lymph nodes or close margins are involved.\n",
      "   - Systemic Therapy: \n",
      "     - Endocrine therapy: Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, depending on menopausal status.\n",
      "     - Chemotherapy: Considering the high Ki-67 proliferation rate, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve outcomes.\n",
      "     - Targeted Therapy: If **PIK3CA mutation** becomes relevant in recurrence or progression, alpelisib could be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Communication to Move Forward:\n",
      "It is crucial to review lymph node biopsy results before finalizing the treatment plan. I will now anticipate the oncologist's decision on whether additional imaging or diagnostic tests are needed before moving forward with the biopsy.\n",
