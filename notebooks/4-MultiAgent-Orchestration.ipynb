      "- 4 tbsp cornstarch\n",

      "1. **Mix & Heat Up:** In a saucepan, whisk a little bit of cold milk with the cornstarch until it dissolves completely. Add the sugar, the remaining milk, and cream, then heat slowly over medium heat. Stir continuously to avoid lumps.\n",
      "2. **Add Aroma:** Once the mixture begins to thicken, lower the heat and gently stir in the rosewater. Keep stirring until the pudding is glossy and smooth.\n",
      "3. **Chill:** Pour the mixture into serving dishes or glass bowls. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or until set.\n",
      "4. **Decorate:** Before serving, sprinkle each malabi with crushed pistachios, a bit of shredded coconut, or drizzle with sweet pomegranate syrup for both flavor and color.\n",

      "\n",
      "At a high level, Semantic Kernel Agents act as intermediaries between humans and machines, facilitating more natural interactions by integrating semantic understanding into artificial intelligence. These agents draw upon the power of semantic kernels—structured systems that organize and interpret information based on meaning—combined with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike conventional AI systems, which rely on input-output mechanics without deeper comprehension, Semantic Kernel Agents make use of memory, context-awareness, and reasoning capabilities to adapt dynamically to user needs. By leveraging pre-built prompts, embeddings, and machine learning functions, they seamlessly connect natural language with computing tasks, making the AI feel intuitive and—well—human-like.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Are Semantic Kernel Agents a Quantum Leap?\n",
      "\n",
      "While powerful AI technologies like LLMs already dominate headlines, their integration into production-level applications can still suffer from rigid designs and limited adaptability. Enter Semantic Kernel technology, designed specifically to bridge this gap by introducing robust programmable interfaces and agents that maximize the untapped potential of AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine working with an AI-powered productivity assistant capable of remembering previous conversations and understanding how they connect to tasks you're currently performing. Or envision project management software capable of using contextual clues from emails, documents, and meeting notes to design action plans autonomously. These aren’t futuristic scenarios—they are very much within reach thanks to Semantic Kernel Agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Building Blocks: How Do They Work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Semantic Kernel Agents comprise several core components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Memory**: Unlike traditional task-oriented AI programs, these agents have access to memory, enabling them to retain and recall relevant information from past interactions. This builds a contextual foundation for smoother conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Skills**: Developers can integrate specialized skills, essentially functional algorithms that help agents execute specific tasks such as scheduling meetings, summarizing documents, or generating creative solutions.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - **Pulmonary Congestion Secondary to Cardiac Dysfunction**: This could happen in early heart failure or with certain valve disorders (e.g., mitral regurgitation).\n",
      "   - **Arrhythmias Triggered by Exercise**: Irregular heartbeats may impair efficient blood and oxygen delivery to the lungs, causing compensatory noisy breathing.\n",
      "   - **Impaired Cardiac Output or Ischemia**: During exercise, the heart may fail to meet the oxygen demand due to conditions like coronary artery disease. This, in turn, may lead to labored or noisy breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Action Plan for Cardiac Assessment:\n",
      "1. **Diagnostic Tests**:\n",

      "   - **Holter Monitor/Loop Recorder**:\n",
      "     - If arrhythmias are suspected during exercise, extended monitoring may help.\n",
      "   - Consider **Cardiac MRI** or **Chest X-ray**\n",
      "     - To visualize the heart, lungs, or fluid buildup if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Risk Factor Evaluation**:\n",
      "   - Check blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels for signs of vascular disease or cardiac risk.\n",
      "   - Rule out anemia (hemoglobin/iron levels), as it can mimic similar symptoms.\n",

      "1. **Track Symptoms**:\n",
      "   - When do the sounds start? (e.g., during warm-up, peak exertion, or cool-down)\n",
      "   - Are there any associated symptoms like chest tightness, wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consult a Specialist**:\n",
      "   - **Pulmonologist**: For evaluation of lung function (spirogram or peak flow test), especially if exercise-induced asthma is suspected.\n",
      "   - **Cardiologist**: If there's chest discomfort or suspicion of cardiac causes.\n",
      "   - **ENT Specialist**: To rule out vocal cord dysfunction or airway obstructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adjust Workouts**:\n",
      "   - Gradually increase exercise intensity.\n",
      "   - Perform a longer warm-up and cool-down to reduce stress on your lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitor Environmental Triggers**:\n",
      "   - Cold air, allergens, or pollution can exacerbate breathing issues. Exercise in a controlled environment if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Follow-Up**:\n",
      "   - Based on specialist findings, treatments might include:\n",
      "     - Short-acting bronchodilators (rescue inhaler) before exercise.\n",
      "     - Breathing exercises or physical therapy if it’s a throat-related issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "Schedule a visit with your primary care physician to discuss your symptoms further and get appropriate referrals. Ensure you describe the sounds and other symptoms clearly.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 **Cardiologist:**\n",
      "   As your cardiologist, it's essential to rule out any cardiovascular involvement in your symptoms. \"Funny sounds\" during breathing when exercising might not just be due to pulmonary or airway issues but could also indicate cardiovascular causes, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Decreased oxygen delivery due to cardiac output issues**:\n",
      "   - Conditions like heart valve disorders (e.g., aortic stenosis) or reduced heart efficiency may present as difficulty in breathing or audible signs of respiratory strain.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Heart failure**:  \n",
      "   - Even in early stages, fluid buildup in the lungs due to a failing heart can cause wheezing or audible respirations, especially during exertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Exercise-induced arrhythmias**:\n",
      "   - Abnormal heart rhythms during exercise can indirectly cause breathlessness or strain on the respiratory system. These need monitoring with tools like a treadmill stress test or a Holter monitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cardiologist-Specific Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Immediate actions**:\n",
      "   - Ensure a cardiac evaluation, including an **ECG, echocardiogram**, and potentially an **exercise stress test**, to rule out underlying heart conditions.\n",
      "   - Consider checking **oxygen saturation** during exercise to assess any mismatch in oxygen supply and demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Risk Factors**:\n",
      "   - History of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, or high cholesterol may predispose you to cardiac-related issues causing such symptoms, especially during exercise. Make sure these factors are well-managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Refer for Pulmonary and ENT Check First If Needed**:\n",
      "   - If breathing difficulty is related solely to airway involvement (as confirmed by pulmonology/ENT opinions), it would help to rule out non-cardiac concerns before undergoing more invasive cardiac evaluations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you've been evaluated for cardiac issues before or if there are other symptoms, such as chest pain, fatigue, or palpitations, so I can advise further.\n",

      "🤖 **Nutritionist:**\n",
      "   After analyzing inputs from the General Doctor and Cardiologist, it is clear that your symptoms may align with respiratory, vascular, or neurological factors. My focus will now be on the **neurological aspect of your concern**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Neurological Insights on Breathing Sounds During Exercise:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Vocal Cord Dysfunction or Laryngeal Function Anomalies**:\n",
      "   - Your \"funny breathing sounds\" could result from **vocal cord hyperactivity** (mismatched opening and closing during breathing), which is a neurological regulation issue. \n",
      "   - A dysfunction in the nerve signaling between the **medulla oblongata** (respiratory control center in the brainstem) and laryngeal muscles might cause unusual sounds while breathing under stress (e.g., during workouts).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Autonomic Nervous System Dysregulation**:\n",
      "   - Intense workouts can overstimulate the **sympathetic nervous system**, potentially causing erratic breathing patterns or even hyperventilation. This could be further compounded by underlying autonomic nervous system imbalances.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Impaired Central Respiratory Drive**:\n",
      "   - Your brain stems (e.g., medulla and pons) regulate respiration during physical activity. Neurological issues like minor **brainstem abnormalities** or disruptions in CO2 regulation sensors might contribute to abnormal breathing sounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Phrenic Nerve or Diaphragmatic Challenges**:\n",
      "   - If there's weakness or pressure on the **phrenic nerves** (which control the diaphragm), breathing during exercise may become shallow, leading to audible or “straining” sounds. This could stem from nerve compression or inflammation in the cervical spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### My Recommendations for Neurological Investigation:\n",
      "1. **Specialist Evaluation**:\n",
      "   - See a **neurologist** to check if nerve-related factors (phrenic nerve, brainstem activity, vocal cord nerve signaling, etc.) may be behind your breathing anomaly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Tests to Consider**:\n",
      "   - **MRI/CT Scan of the Cervical Spine and Brainstem**: Rule out any structural issues impacting nerve relay for diaphragmatic activity.\n",
      "   - **Electromyography (EMG)** of the diaphragm: Assess nerve function controlling respiration.\n",
      "   - **ENT Focus**: A video scope check for neurological signs of vocal cord dysfunction often presents during intense workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Neurological Breathing Exercises**:\n",
      "   - Breathing patterns can be regulated through targeted autonomic techniques, such as mindful breathing or vagus nerve stimulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summarized Strategy (Considering All Inputs):\n",
      "- Initial focus should be on **pulmonary and cardiac evaluations**.\n",
      "- If these come back clear, proceed with **neurological assessments** to check for nerve activity impairments or autonomic dysregulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your symptoms might be multifactorial, but documenting symptoms carefully - including timing and environmental triggers - is essential for identifying the correct underlying diagnosis. Let me know if new information or results emerge.\n",

      "🤖 **GeneralDoctor:**\n",
      "   After consolidating insights from all specialties (general, cardiology, neurology), here’s a **concise action plan** for your symptoms of \"funny breathing sounds\" during exercise:  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Primary Investigations**  \n",
      "- **Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT)**: To check for exercise-induced bronchospasm (e.g., asthma) or other airway disorders.\n",
      "- **ENT Evaluation**: Rule out vocal cord dysfunction or structural obstructions using laryngoscopy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Cardiac Assessment**  \n",
      "- Perform an ECG, echocardiogram, and possibly a treadmill stress test to rule out heart-related causes like arrhythmias or valve issues that affect breathing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Neurological Follow-Up**  \n",
      "- If initial tests are inconclusive, consult a neurologist for an assessment of vocal cord nerve dysfunction, autonomic nervous system imbalances, or diaphragmatic nerve control issues.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Practical Steps  \n",
      "- In the meantime, try to:\n",
      "  - Warm up longer and avoid cold or allergen-heavy environments.  \n",
      "  - Keep a log of symptoms, noting exercise type, intensity, and environmental factors.  \n",
      "  - Avoid overexertion until an underlying cause is identified.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This integrated approach should help rule out or pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. Let us know additional details or test results, and we’ll refine the plan further!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 **Cardiologist:**\n",
      "   Based on all the provided insights, let's consolidate everything with a primary cardiology-oriented focus, since the cardiovascular system could be a key player in your exercise-induced symptoms. Here's a concise cardiac evaluation plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cardiologist’s Specific Concerns:\n",
      "1. **Exercise-Induced Breath Sounds** might indicate:\n",
      "   - **Pulmonary Congestion Secondary to Cardiac Dysfunction**: This could happen in early heart failure or with certain valve disorders (e.g., mitral regurgitation).\n",
      "   - **Arrhythmias Triggered by Exercise**: Irregular heartbeats may impair efficient blood and oxygen delivery to the lungs, causing compensatory noisy breathing.\n",
      "   - **Impaired Cardiac Output or Ischemia**: During exercise, the heart may fail to meet the oxygen demand due to conditions like coronary artery disease. This, in turn, may lead to labored or noisy breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Action Plan for Cardiac Assessment:\n",
      "1. **Diagnostic Tests**:\n",
      "   - **Echocardiogram**:\n",
      "     - To evaluate heart function, structure, and potential valvular problems.\n",
      "   - **Exercise Stress Test/Treadmill Test**:\n",
      "     - To observe symptoms and cardiac changes during exertion.\n",
      "   - **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**:\n",
      "     - To detect any underlying electrical abnormalities in your heart.\n",
      "   - **Holter Monitor/Loop Recorder**:\n",
      "     - If arrhythmias are suspected during exercise, extended monitoring may help.\n",
      "   - Consider **Cardiac MRI** or **Chest X-ray**\n",
      "     - To visualize the heart, lungs, or fluid buildup if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Risk Factor Evaluation**:\n",
      "   - Check blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels for signs of vascular disease or cardiac risk.\n",
      "   - Rule out anemia (hemoglobin/iron levels), as it can mimic similar symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Interim Safety Measures for Exercise:\n",
      "- Start with **moderate-intensity workouts**:\n",
      "  - Avoid high-intensity activities until the cardiac evaluation is complete.\n",
      "- Monitor your heart rate during exercise using a wrist tracker. Report any unusually high rates or palpitations.\n",
      "- Report to a medical professional **immediately** if you experience:\n",
      "  - Chest pain\n",
      "  - Dizziness\n",
      "  - Profound shortness of breath or unusual fatigue\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps:\n",
      "Once a cardiac workup is completed, additional respiratory or neurological causes (exercise-induced bronchospasm, vocal cord dysfunction, or autonomic dysregulation) can be explored further, if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Always approach this step-by-step to ensure the best path to diagnosis. Let me know if you experience any additional symptoms or changes, as they may guide more specific recommendations.\n",
