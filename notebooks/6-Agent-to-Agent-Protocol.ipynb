    "# Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**, a standardized communication protocol developed by Google for enabling seamless interaction between AI agents across different systems and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the A2A Protocol?\n",
    "\n",
    "The A2A protocol is an open standard that defines how AI agents can discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other, regardless of their underlying implementation or hosting infrastructure. Think of it as HTTP for AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardized Communication**: JSON-RPC 2.0 based protocol for agent-to-agent messaging\n",
    "- **Agent Discovery**: Well-known endpoint (`/.well-known/agent.json`) for agent capabilities\n",
    "- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with any AI provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Claude, local models, etc.)\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Enables agents from different vendors to work together\n",
    "- **Protocol Compliance**: Includes validation and inspection tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌─────────────────┐\n",
    "│  Client Agent   │  (Your application with SK agents)\n",

    "│  Integration    │\n",

    "  (A2A)    (A2A)     (A2A)       (A2A)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use A2A?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Microservices for AI**: Decompose complex AI systems into specialized agents\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Share agents across different applications and teams\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Scale individual agents independently\n",
    "4. **Security**: Isolate sensitive operations in dedicated agents\n",
    "5. **Multi-Vendor**: Mix agents from different providers\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning**: The A2A protocol is still under development and evolving rapidly. These examples use [SharpA2A.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpA2A.Core) which tracks the protocol specification.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **A2A enables microservices architecture for AI agents**\n",
    "   - Decompose monolithic AI systems\n",
    "   - Scale and maintain components independently\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardization enables interoperability**\n",
    "   - Different teams can share agents\n",
    "   - Mix vendors and technologies\n",
    "   - Easier integration and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Protocol-based communication is flexible**\n",
    "   - HTTP-based (works with existing infrastructure)\n",
    "   - JSON-RPC 2.0 (widely supported)\n",
    "   - Language and framework agnostic\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Semantic Kernel integrates naturally**\n",
    "   - Use SK agents as A2A servers\n",
    "   - Leverage SK's plugin system\n",
    "   - Combine with other SK features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the [A2A specification](https://google.github.io/A2A/)\n",
    "- Try the [Semantic Kernel A2A samples](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/dotnet/samples/Demos/A2AClientServer)\n",
    "- Build your own A2A server with SharpA2A.Core\n",
    "- Test with the A2A Inspector tool\n",
    "- See Assignment 4 for hands-on practice"
