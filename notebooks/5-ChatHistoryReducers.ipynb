    "# Chat History Reducers in Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the concept of Chat History Reducers - a crucial pattern for managing token usage and context window limitations when working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in conversational scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models operate with a defined limit on the number of tokens they can process at once, referred to as the **context window**. Exceeding this limit can have significant cost and performance implications. Therefore, it is essential to manage the size of the input sent to the LLM, particularly when using chat completion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat History Reducers provide strategies to truncate chat history when it becomes too large, while preserving the most important context for meaningful conversations."
