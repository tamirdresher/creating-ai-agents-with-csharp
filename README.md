# Semantic Kernel C# Workshop

A comprehensive workshop for building AI applications and agents using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework in C#.

## 📚 Workshop Overview

This workshop teaches you how to create intelligent AI agents that can collaborate as a software development team. You'll learn to build an AI Coding Assistant capable of performing complex software development tasks through multi-agent orchestration.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### 📓 Interactive Notebooks
